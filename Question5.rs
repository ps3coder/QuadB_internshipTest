// 1) we know that Median = (n + 1) รท 2
// 2) now we will create a function median that takes the array as a input and if the length is more than 0 then processes to the next step
// 3) so if the length says that the given array is even than we will apply the even method to find median
// 4) and if the number is find odd than we will find the odd method to find the median and return it to the main function
